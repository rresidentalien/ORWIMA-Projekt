            <h2>Vienna and Kraków - August 2025</h2>
            <p>As far as I recall, this was the first I travelled somewhere by train entirely alone! It was a pretty
                exciting trip too, as I had visited Poland for the first time ever.</p>

            <h3>What I did in Vienna and Kraków</h3>
            <p>I was away for a week total in the first week of August, and made a small day trip to Kraków, spending
                the rest of the time in Vienna. Travelling excites me, and I also enjoyed seeing all the different
                trains in a whooping FIVE countries! List as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An ÖBB Nightjet all the way from Paris had a (fortunate for me) one hour delay, and I happened to
                    run right into it as it pulled into Wien Hbf. I was not even aware that this 17-or-so-hour service
                    existed, and I was so surprised that I did a double take upon seeing it on the big timetable screen!
                </li>
                <li>Countless ÖBB-operated Railjet services</li>
                <li>A Deutsche Bahn ICE train at Wien Hbf that I suspect had come from Nürnberg Hbf</li>
                <li>LEO Express owned Stadler FLIRT in Bohumín</li>
                <li>A couple of Arriva trains - in Croatia, Arriva only operates buses!</li>
                <li>The beautiful Alstom New Pendolino for PKP InterCity at Kraków Główny</li>
                <li>Many RJX and S-Bahn trains at Wien Hbf and all throughout the city</li>
            </ul>
