            <h3>What I did in Budapest</h3>
            <p>I spent 5 days in Budapest, so I've seen, done and eaten plenty! But since this is a website about
                trains, I'll stick to that. I visited Budapest-Keleti on two occasions specifically for train-watching
                and oh was it full of new things! I'll share photos below, but here's a summary:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>MÁV Stadler Kiss and Flirt. I loved these so much, I even got plushies of them! I took the Flirt on
                    a small day-trip to Gödöllő - specifically the MÁTRA InterRegio service that continues toward
                    Gyöngyös</li>
                <li>ÖBB-operated Railjet service from Budapest-Keleti to Wien Hbf, using the standard Siemens Viaggio
                    Comfort carriages, hauled by a EuroSprinter</li>
                <li>A GYSEV engine that I was so excited to see (I'd only ever seen their multiple units before), that I
                    don't even remember what it was hauling! The following day I was additionally lucky to see one in a
                    special commemorative wrap celebrating 150 years of Raaberbahn</li>
                <li>A whole bunch of wagons belonging to Ukrzaliznytsia (Ukrainian Railways). I was sad to miss the
                    outgoing train to Mukachevo, but seeing these stacked up aside while returning from Gödöllő sort of
                    made up for it. Made me very happy, for sure!</li>
                <li>Drava InterCity headed west toward Ljubljana</li>
                <li>Wagons belonging to Železničná spoločnosť Slovensko (Railway Company Slovakia) set aside at Keleti
                </li>
                <li>Second-class CFR-branded wagons stopped at Keleti, on a trip from Wien Hbf to Baia Mare</li>
            </ul>
