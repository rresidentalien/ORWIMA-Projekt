            <p>Although this was not a train trip per se - I had merely taken the train once or twice during a much
                longer trip - I felt like it deserved to be mentioned as it was quite pleasant, and people may not
                expect so.</p>

            <h3>Travel path</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>One short ride, getting on at Larkspur station and off on the very next stop - San Rafael - 7
                    minutes later</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What I did in the Bay Area</h3>
            <p>Little of what I did relates to this train website (as cars dominate the US, and public transport, albeit
                way better in the Bay Area than elsewhere, is scarce), but I don't wish to be so brief, so here's some
                context on my rail journey! <br>
                Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit, or SMART for short, is a railway system running in the Sonoma and Marin
                counties of Northern California. It has a whooping one service, running from Larkspur to Windsor. It is
                part of the wider Bay Area transit system and as such, can be paid for with the Clipper card. So you can
                use various forms of public transport from various companies and never know the difference - convenient!
                The SMART service runs on a single-track rail line that is in total 77 km long. I took the train after
                reaching Larkspur by bike from San Francisco, tired and eager to return to San Rafael. The SMART trains
                are of course also equipped with bicycle racks.
                <br>
                So in short, all I saw was:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A SMART Nippon Sharyo diesel multiple unit. Surprisingly quiet and smooth for a DMU, with a very
                    nice, comfortable interior.</li>
            </ul>
