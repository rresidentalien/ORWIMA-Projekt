            <h2>Vienna and Bratislava - December 2024</h2>
            <p>This was a pretty short weekend trip to Vienna just before Christmas. I also got to go to Bratislava in
                one afternoon. Pro tip: The best Christmas market for food in Vienna is... the one in Bratislava. Up
                your food game, Austrians!</p>

            <h3>What I did in Vienna and Bratislava</h3>
            <p>Nothing overly productive was done on this trip. Pretty much all I did for four days was eat food, look
                at Christmas decorations and eat more food. As such not many trains were seen either, but there
                <i>were</i> some news.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All of the standard-for-me ÖBB and MÁV InterCity services!</li>
                <li>ÖBB RJX train to Bratislava. Now, these are technically not new to me - I regularly commute in
                    Vienna by S-Bahn, which typically uses the Siemens Desiro. But on the S-Bahn stops you can also
                    often see the RJX trains, which are typically double-deckers (Stadler KISS, I believe). Of course, I
                    have made the mistake before and took the RJX instead of the S-Bahn, nearly ending up in Czechia!
