                <h2>Welcome to Trainwatchers!</h2>
                <p>Trainwatchers is an info site / personal blog about trains. Here you can find some information and
                    travel
                    ideas related to trains in Europe (and a little bit about elsewhere). Whenever I travel, I prefer to
                    go
                    by train, and so having learned some useful facts over time, I decided to gather them here for
                    others to
                    learn. I hope you'll find this website useful!</p>

            <h2>Train travel tips</h2>
            <p>The best way to travel by train from eastern Croatia to other countries in Europe is through
                Hungary (Hungarian Railways / MÁV). From Osijek there is a direct train to Beli Manastir, from
                where MÁV runs a direct service to Pécs for only 2.5 euros. Budapest is then only some 12 euros
                away, and from Budapest you can directly or indirectly get just about anywhere in Europe by
                train - Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine directly, and then onward wherever you'd
                like.</p>
            <p>
                The cheapest way to travel by train is often likewise by buying tickets from MÁV. The aforementioned 12
                euro ticket to Budapest is actually only 6 euros if you are a student like myself - MÁV offers a 50%
                discount to young adults. Apart from them, PKP (Polish State Railways) and České dráhy (Czech Railways)
                tend to also have cheap tickets compared to some other sellers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most convenient and also generally
                the most expensive train ticket vendor is in my opinion ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways). On their
                website you can find train tickets to just about anywhere in Europe, even if you're not starting or
                ending your trip in Austria, so it's convenient to only buy a
                single ticket for your whole trip with them. However, the convenience comes with a price, and the
                tickets on their website are typically two times pricier, sometimes more. Additionally, they require you
                to have international tickets printed on paper, which is not the case with any other company that I
                encountered.

                If you are crossing country lines by train, you will most likely find yourself in an engine-pulled
                configuration rather than a multiple unit train. It is nearly impossible to know what kind of wagon you
                could find yourself assigned to, let alone choose a nice one - but there are some tips and tricks for a
                more pleasant journey. On InterCity trains, wagons with compartments are rather rare and you will most
                likely have a 2-by-2 configuration with a table between the pairs. Not ideal if travelling alone! I
                prefer to book an aisle seat so I'm not sandwiched next to someone, but you may prefer the window seat
                so
                that you can close the curtain if you wish, or charge your phone (the outlets are often though not
                always by the window).
            </p>
            <p>
                On the topic of trying to choose a good wagon - on the off-chance that you do get to choose (because
                seat reservations are almost always required to purchase beforehand), InterCity branded MÁV wagons are
                my go-to. They have lovely and soft green seats, with a large wood table. Railjet wagons should in
                theory all be the same, at least for ÖBB ones. In practice, I do recall occasionally getting different
                ones. In any case, all of the wagons do at least have in common the fact that the journey will be smooth
                and quiet, since you don't have an engine under yourself like in multiple units (fellow Croats will
                understand
                this very well).
