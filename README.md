# Trainwatchers

Trainwatchers is an info site / personal blog about trains. Here you can find some information and travel ideas related to trains in Europe (and a little bit about elsewhere). Whenever I travel, I prefer to go by train, and so having learned some useful facts over time, I decided to gather them here for others to learn. I hope you'll find this website useful!
